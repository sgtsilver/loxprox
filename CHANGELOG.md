# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- Complete six-layer security stack: nftables → nginx → CrowdSec → Firewall Bouncer → AppSec WAF → AppArmor/auditd
- `deploy.sh` — idempotent Debian 12 hardening script (870 lines)
- `test-gateway.sh` — 29-check automated validation suite
- `set-static-ip.sh` — VM network pre-configuration
- `security-monitoring/` — Discord alerts, health monitor, config backup, GeoIP blocking
- CrowdSec AppSec WAF integration with nginx `auth_request` (200+ CVE virtual patches)
- Discord webhook alerting for security events
- Configurable via `.env` pattern
- Raspberry Pi compatibility research and documentation
- Full threat model and incident response playbook in `SECURITY.md`

### Fixed
- CrowdSec AppSec HTTP 401 "missing API key" — discovered required `X-Crowdsec-Appsec-*` headers and bouncer API key authentication flow
- Monitor script locale bug (`LC_ALL=C free` for non-English systems)
- deploy.sh `set -e` compatibility (fixed `check_root` and `backup_file` functions)
- CrowdSec whitelist CIDR parser (was using `ip:` for ranges, caused FATAL error)
- nginx rate limit 503s on Loxone UI assets (burst increased 20→100)

### Security
- AppSec WAF switched from `monitor` to `enforce` mode
- nftables input policy: DROP
- SSH restricted to LAN + site-to-site subnets
- Kernel hardening: syncookies, rp_filter, dmesg_restrict, ASLR
- AppArmor nginx profile enforced
- auditd monitoring for config changes and privilege escalation
- unattended-upgrades with auto-reboot for kernel patches

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- CrowdSec IDS + firewall bouncer (nftables)
- Basic rate limiting and connection caps
- Security headers via nginx

### Fixed
- IP migration from DHCP to static `.252`
- Router cutover: external port 1080 forwarded to gateway
